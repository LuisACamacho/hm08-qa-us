# Sprint 8 project

# The purpose of the project is to utilize Automated UI testing to test out a functionality seen in the Urban Routes website.  

# The technologies used to make the testing are using VS code IDE to write JavaScript code and using the “WebdriverIO” framework. As well, DevTools was used to determine HTML elements and their tags.  The technique to test and organize the code was by utilizing the Mocha library. In the code, there were three files that were developed to create the organization of the code. The page.js file is made of locators that consist of buttons, input fields, and models. Also, it contains the functions that have the logic of the tests with using the locators. The helper.js file contains functions that generate valid input data to be used in the page.js functions. The createAnOrder.e2e.js file contains the function calls that are organized to test the functionality.
